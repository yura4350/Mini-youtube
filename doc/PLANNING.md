## Questions or Concerns

 *


## Project Goals

 * Domain: Video Streaming

 * Micro-services
    - Commnunication
    - Intelligence

 * Programming languages, Frontend frameworks, and Database
 - Python for backend (FastAPI, to be discussed)
 - React (TypeScript) for frontend (Next.js)
 - Database: RDBMS vs NoSQL???


## Use Cases

### User Accounts and Preferences

1. **Registration (Create account)**
   - User signs up with email, username, password (and any additional data we need)
   - System validates user input (email format, password length, etc.)
   - System checks for duplicate emails/usernames
   - System hashes and stores password

2. **Login**
   - User logs in with their credentials
   - System verifies password, returns session token

3. **Handle invalid login**
   - System returns error for incorrect credentials
   - System does rate limiting after certain number of failed attempts

4. **Reset password**
   - User requests reset
   - System generates temporary password (or some kind of token)
   - User submits new password and temporary password (or token)
   - Temporary password gets expired

5. **Logout**
   - User clicks logout button
   - System redirects to main page (non-logged in version)

6. **View user profile**
   - User clicks on profile button and views their profile

7. **Edit user profile**
   - User updates profile (e.g. new username) via edit/save button
   - System validates user input

8. **Privacy settings**
   - User toggles privacy-related settings (e.g. public/private profiles, etc.)

9. **Notification settings**
   - User configures push notification, chat notification (from real-time chat/messaging)

10. **UI settings**
    - User decides the layout/order of videos being displayed, size of the video screen, etc.

### Admin Dashboard

1. **View system health**
   - Admin clicks on the button to check health
   - System sends a request to /health endpoint
   - Admin sees the result of the reply

2. **View user counts**
   - Admin sees the current real-time user counts
   - Real-time user counts are consistently updated with the calls to some endpoints of REST API
   - Admin sees the updated user counts real-time

3. **View logs**
   - Admin sees the current logs
   - Real-time logs are consistently updated with the calls to some endpoints of REST API
   - Admin sees the updated user logs real-time

4. **Ban user**
   - Admin selects the user to ban them in the UI
   - The patch request is sent to the backend
   - Frontend makes another request to the backend and gets updated

5. **Reset password**
   - Admin can reset their own password
   - The request is sent to the backend
   - Backend sends the email through email service
   - Admin restores the password
   - Password changes in the database
   - Admin can log in now

6. **Delete content**
   - Admin deletes certain video
   - Patch request sent to the database (or wherever we store videos)

7. **View metrics**
   - Admin can go to the metrics window
   - Metrics are updated in real time through sending the get requests to the backend

### Dashboard and Search

1. **Looking for Videos**
   - User logs in
   - The system detects whether the user has any history:
     - If there is, the system generates video recommendations based on trending algorithms and the user's watching history
     - If there is not, the system generates recommendations based solely on trending topics and location-based hotspots
   - User selects a video from the recommendation feed
   - The system retrieves the video metadata and stream URL, adding the new video history to this user's information
   - The system initiates the video player and begins streaming

2. **Search Input**
   - User enters keywords into the search bar on the homepage
   - The system provides real-time search suggestions based on the input
   - The system filters and ranks videos based on relevance, keywords, and user preferences

3. **Subscription list**
   - User views subscription tab, which shows the latest videos from subscribed creators (in chronological order)

4. **Recently watched**
   - User views recently watched videos

5. **Notification tab**
   - User sees notification inbox that contains recent notifications, marked read or unread

6. **Search history**
   - When clicks on the search bar, the system displays a short list of recent search history

7. **Subscribed channel tab**
   - User views a list of channels currently subscribed to
   - User can edit channel-specific settings (unsubscribe, enable/disable notification from the channel, etc.)

8. **Uploaded videos tab**
   - User views a list of uploaded videos by that user

9. **User Profile**
   - When clicks on the Profile section of the Dashboard, the user will be navigated to the Profile page
   - The system retrieves and displays the current profile data (Name, Bio, Avatar…)

### Concurrent CRUD Access

1. **Atomic View Count Update**
   - Multiple users are watching the same viral video simultaneously, which will cause race conditions
   - The system uses an atomic increment (maybe in Redis) and syncs the batch totals asynchronously to the database

2. **Video Metadata Edit**
   - User A changes the Title of the video
   - User B changes the Description of the video seconds later
   - The system uses a version column to update the information of the video

3. **Invalid video metadata during upload**
   - User submits empty title, overly long description, etc.
   - Reject request to upload

4. **Unique email and username**
   - Two users try to use the same email or username
   - System only allows one of the two requests

### Intelligence

1. **AI-summarize**
   - The button to AI-summarize is clicked by user
   - The request is sent to the backend
   - Based on the subtitles the LLM agent is called to summarize the video
   - The summary is returned to the frontend

2. **User can tag their content**
   - The user adds a tag to the content on the frontend
   - The patch request is sent to the backend
   - The database is updated to reflect the tag

3. **User can see the tags**
   - When the user looks at the video
   - The request to backend is sent
   - Backend fetches database and returns tags
   - Tags are displayed with a video

4. **User gets recommended videos based on title and author history**
   - When the dashboard is loaded, Intelligence microservice is called to calculate recommendations
   - Backend determines recommended videos
   - Recommended videos are shown in the user feed

### Communication

1. **New video notification**
   - If there is a new video uploaded to a channel which the user is already subscribed to, system pushes notification
   - System stores notification in an inbox

2. **Notification Inbox**
   - User opens notification tab (or possibly a dashboard) and sees a list of unread notifications
   - System marks as read if user clicks to check the notification

3. **Real-time chat**
   - If multiple users are online, the message is delivered instantly
   - (One real-time chat for each video/trending video/live stream, etc.)

4. **Subscription notification**
   - User subscribes to a new channel
   - System sends a notification to confirm subscription

5. **Chat notification**
   - If there is an active conversation in a previously participated chat, system sends a notification to the user
